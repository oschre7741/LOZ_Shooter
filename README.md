To start the game, press the keypad enter. Once the game starts, use the left and right arrow keys to move side to side and press space to shoot the Keese and Octorok. 

The Keese are worth 100 points each, and each level more spawn. There are three types of Keese, but they are all worth 100 points and are killed in one hit. They drop bombs, which take 1 health point if you get hit. If you are hit by any of the Keese, you instantly die and loose the game.

The Octorok is a special enemy. It is worth 1000 points, but moves a lot faster and only shows up once each level. You don't take damage if hit by the Octorok.

Once you beat all 3 levels of the game, you win the Triforce and save Hyrule. 

To quit the game, press the X key.

To restart the game, press the R key.
